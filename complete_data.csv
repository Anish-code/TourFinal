2426062,Purna Yoga & Treks,"Purna Yoga & Treks (also known as Nepal Yoga Trek) is a pioneer of yoga trekking tours in Nepal. Many people come to Nepal to experience the beauty and magic of trekking in the Himalayas. The idea of combining yoga with trekking was born in 2008 and we have been passionate in organizing yoga treks in Nepal ever since. At Purna Yoga & Treks, as skilled trekking guides and passionate yoga teachers, we wanted to offer people a better way to experience some of the world's most breathtaking scenery. After much experimenting and exploration on how to integrate trekking and yoga we found a winning formula. Our yoga treks and tours have been carefully designed to combine the best elements of each. We provide a gentle trekking schedule, healthy food, stretches for weary muscles, breathing exercises to ease breathing and time to relax, reflect and enjoy the location. Each day starts with a short meditation and gentle yoga session to awaken you to the beauty that surrounds you and connects your senses with nature. We take time to stretch even during the day to prevent muscle strain. At times we also stop along the trail to really appreciate the surroundings and meditate on the sound of a flowing river or engage in mountain gazing meditation. Afternoons are marked with yoga nidra - guided relaxation which allows us to integrate the day's experiences and is deeply rejuvenating.
